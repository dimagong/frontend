# User related documentation. Anything that can be done within the NMP UI goes here.

## Why need this api documentation?

The NMP project uses many different requests to the back end. Each fragment of the project has specific requests with very complex business logic. Thus, it makes sense to create separate API documents that allow developers to understand the API and its purpose very quickly in order to implement new features or improve existing ones.

All files has name according to particular request. We can see both structure of request and response.

### What web services are we using?

API specifications typically include information such as supported operations, parameters and outputs, authorization requirements, available endpoints and licenses needed. Swagger can generate this information automatically from the source code by asking the API to return a documentation file from its annotations.

Swagger helps users build, document, test and consume RESTful web services.
