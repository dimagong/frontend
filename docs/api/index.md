# User related documentation. Anything that can be done within the NMP UI goes here.

## Why need this api documentation?

The NMP project uses many different requests to the back end. Each fragment of the project has specific requests with very complex business logic. Thus, it makes sense to create separate API documents that allow developers to understand the API and its purpose very quickly in order to implement new features or improve existing ones.
