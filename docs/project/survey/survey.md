# Surveys

Surveys, which is also an extension of the onboarding process, provides the ability for Managers to design and conduct competency tests among Members. Managers can grade completed Surveys, after which NMP will automatically collate the results and provide a summary.

NMP Surveys follows the same paradigm of Dynamic Forms, in that Surveys can be designed by the Managers, as well as also being plugged into workflows so Managers have full control over how NMP reacts to user inputs and state changes over time.

Further, Survey questions are version controlled so that Surveys can evolve over time without affecting the integrity of historically conducted Surveys.
Digitising this process saves time with regard to marking and recording the results of the survey, as well as making it easier to keep the Surveys up to date.
