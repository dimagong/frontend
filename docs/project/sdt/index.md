# Suggested Data Types

SDT is designed to standardise input fields (such as text, select, file uploads) for each mastershema element. This will ensure that each data element is captured uniformly across all input mechanisms such as dForms. Added advantages of SDT are: Further simplification of the dForm design process, improved data integrity and form consistency.

With built in version control, the SDT of each MS element can evolve over time, whilst still allowing managers to view changes over time.
