### Create invitation

#### Description

Guest invite will allow Managers to temporarily invite a guest into the system to provide specific data to supplement a Members profile. An example of this would be a reference provider providing specific information about a Members past experience. This ‘Reference Provider’ would be granted access to the system as a Guest, and will have temporary, limited access in which they submit the requested information.
