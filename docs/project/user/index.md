### Entity Management (Authorised Representatives)

NMP has a roles and permissions structure that reflects the business structure of the network, including Authorised representative (Member Firms) as well as the IFAs themselves (Members).

The entity management feature enables Managers to group up Members by their Member Firm, which in turn makes user management easier and better documents the relationship between Members and the network itself.
Member Firms also include a MasterSchema, allowing common Member Firm data to be shared across its Members. This eliminates data redundancy and allows better version management of the Member Firm as Members come and go over time.
